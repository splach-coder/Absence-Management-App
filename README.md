# Absence Management App
This is a web application for managing employee absences. The app allows employees to request time off and managers to approve or reject requests, as well as track employee absences and manage leave balances.

The app was built using Node.js, Express, Mongoose, jQuery, Nodemon, EJS, HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript. It also utilizes the body-parser middleware for parsing request bodies.

## Installation and Setup
To run the app locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory.
Start the app by running `npm start`.
create an .env file and create this code `PORT=3000`
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the app.
Note: Before running the app, make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine. You may also need to update the MongoDB connection string in the server.js file to match your configuration.

## Usage
Once the app is running, you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. From there, employees can log in and submit requests for time off, while managers can log in and view and approve or reject requests.

The app also includes a dashboard for tracking employee absences and leave balances, which can be accessed by both employees and managers.
